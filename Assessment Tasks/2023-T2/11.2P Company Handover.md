<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open Data Project engages with The City of Melbourne to support a greater use of their Open Data library for businesses, researchers, and software developers. The Melbourne Open Playground (MOP) is an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage open data using real-world scenarios in order to assist The City of Melbourne to achieve key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company and present it in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and displays the progress of each of its three projects and outlines their goals. This project aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester
The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited. Furthermore, the team aims to implement policies for shared coding practices to provide future teams with detailed references.

#### Deliverables
- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

#### Completion Summary
The team created a significant number of user stories, and team members divided up the user stories into individual tasks. Majority of the team focused on the application development while a small portion of the team focused on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the EVCFLO branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements this trimester:

- Updated the "Map" Screen by populating the EV charging station with real data from an external database.
- Completed security review of Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented "About" Screen providing an overview of the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the application's version.
- Implemented "Terms and Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" Screens.
- Created password reset functionalities allowing users to reset their passwords if required.
- Added functionality to delete user account upon request.
- Implemented "User Details Update" Screen that allows users to change their personal details.
- Created a central Documents directory within the GitHub Repository and added policy documents in markdown.
- Updated GitHub repo readme to include a linking directory to the new policy documents. 

#### Showcase Video
Here you can view the showcase video for the Evoleon App project: [Evoleon Showcase.](https://youtu.be/PBy32WonKms)


#### Future Deliverables 
- Convert application to beta mode and host it on play store allowing users to access and test its features to provide feedback.
- Increase communication and cross collaboration between the EVCFLO and Evoleon team to improve upon both projects' work streams such as merging the backend databases together.
- Add functionality to filter the EV charging stations based on amenities available nearby.
- Implement and update user interface code for the application pages based on the new high-fidelity Figma designs created in Trimester 1 2023.
- Expand and add new features and functionalities to the overall Evoleon application.

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ln6GEN45/melbourne-city)

[GitHub](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP-Code)
<br><br>

#### Goals & Objectives

This project entails the development of an educational platform that showcases the practical applications of Open Data, specifically designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders, such as industry professionals, government entities, and academic researchers. The primary objective of this project is to leverage the utilisation of the [City of Melbourne's Open Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/pages/home/).

The long-term goal is to data useage, facilitating innovative and informed solutions to contemporary challenges across the City of Melbourne council area.

#### Aims this Trimester

The main focus is to apply the new API for the Melbourne Open Data Playground to the remaining unmodified published notebooks so that they will run when downloaded.

The aim for the Data Science team is to create a new set of use cases that fit within the 3 defined key areas of interest from the City Of Melbourne. The team is planning to create new use cases and also have enough in the backlog for trimester 3.

The web team is aiming to further streamline the processes for which the notebooks are published, and working with the design team to optimise the device browsing of our website. As part of the approach to the website, the cyber security team will be conducting tests and an audit, not only for the City of Melbourne Project project but also throughout the whole of Chameleon, to ensure that all projects are up to par when it comes to security, all tests will be reported, and if there are any major issues detected within any of the projects, the security team will ensure the best practices are being


#### Deliverables

- Fix the lingering design / css issues within the website- (Web Dev Team)
- Fix design / css issues on old user case pages- (Web Dev Team)
- Identify vulnerabilities within the projects of Chameleon and offer suggestions to fix them (Cyber Security Team)
- Create a plan to separate the security team of MOP and turn it into the security team of Chameleon (Cyber Security Team)

#### Completion Summary
The Data Science team has brainstormed a new set of use case ideas that fits the 3 defined key areas of interest for the City of Melbourne and added to backlog items on Trello Board. The team also finished several use case analysis ready for published, and completed most of the repointing the APIs for the published notebooks to API 2.0 and 2.1. 

The Cyber Security team has inspected the source code for vulnerabilities, the website has been stress tested for high amounts of traffic in small periods of time, Traversal attacks have been tested and failed against the website, XML Attacks have been tested, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has been tested for the MOP site. The Security team has also been in charge of conducting an audit to test both the Chameleon website and the MOP website. within this audit, many tests were conducted such as SSL verification, vulnerability scanning, error handling, and more. There have also been plans to revamp the security team and have them become a separate entity from MOP and instead be spread across all of Chameleon  

The web dev team has updated most of the missing pages of the MOP website, the team then successfully displayed these missing pages on the website home page and solved the consistency issues on most of the user case page design. The team also implemented new design to couple of the web pages. 

The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed repointing most of the published use case APIs.
- Completed defining a series of use cases to be explored by the DS team.
- Published new use cases
- Fix MOP Website Google Cloud Platform pipeline
- Implemented new design on web pages

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website and to make it optimised for mobile access. While the back-end has yet to be implemented, it means we have much scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal and implementing the Mailgun API and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing with the students’ design and web development skills. We want to deliver a high-quality, attractive, easy-to-navigate and high usability website. To do this, we will implement correct wireframing and prototyping techniques to develop a solid design that meets requirements before implementation.

It will be necessary for the Chameleon Website to showcase all the other projects being carried out by the Chameleon company. Therefore, incorporating these projects into the website has commenced, but links still need to be provided.

| **Jon Suwannakoot** | 220069966 | Undergrad | Senior | Project Lead, Design Team Lead | Yes | As the leader of the Chameleon project and the design team, I contributed to the success of our website by organising weekly meetings and encouraging our members to work as a team, especially when they are working on the same tasks on the Trello board. Most importantly, I ensure that our code for the website is based on the design to enhance usability and appearance. I also designed our new Chameleon and MOP logos to increase visibility and branding to represent our values and goals. Also, I used Figma to create the new MOP website, ensuring that all web pages are consistent with high usability. Moreover, I made the InnoFest poster and presented the Chameleon website on Deakin Open Day and in our classes in weeks 7 and 11.
