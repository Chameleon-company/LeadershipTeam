<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open Data Project engages with The City of Melbourne to support a greater use of their Open Data library for businesses, researchers, and software developers. The Melbourne Open Playground (MOP) is an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage open data using real-world scenarios in order to assist The City of Melbourne to achieve key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company and present it in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and displays the progress of each of its three projects and outlines their goals. This project aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

| **Jon Suwannakoot** | 220069966 | Undergrad | Senior | Project Lead, Design Team Lead | Yes | As the leader of the Chameleon project and the design team, I contributed to the success of our website by organising weekly meetings and encouraging our members to work as a team, especially when they are working on the same tasks on the Trello board. Most importantly, I ensure that our code for the website is based on the design to enhance usability and appearance. I also designed our new Chameleon and MOP logos to increase visibility and branding to represent our values and goals. Also, I used Figma to create the new MOP website, ensuring that all web pages are consistent with high usability.
