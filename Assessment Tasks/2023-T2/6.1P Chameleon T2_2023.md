<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open Data Project engages with The City of Melbourne to support a greater use of their Open Data library for businesses, researchers, and software developers. The Melbourne Open Playground (MOP) is an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage open data using real-world scenarios in order to assist The City of Melbourne to achieve key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company and present it in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and displays the progress of each of its three projects and outlines their goals. This project aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

### <a name="objectives"></a>Trimester 2 2023 Objectives
As well as moving each of the Chameleon projects closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.


- Create and document a policy for the creation and storage of documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. The process will include, migrating company documents to GitHub and converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future studentsb fvc. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company including:
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Having multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

<br> <a name="App dev"></a><h2 style="color:#4CB166">Evoleon</h2>
<h4 style="color:#00A688">Overview</h4>
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations.

<h4 style="color:#00A688">Goals & Objectives</h4>
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket:

- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).  
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route.
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle.


<h4 style="color:#00A688">Aims this Trimester</h4>

The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited.

<h4 style="color:#00A688">Deliverables</h4>

- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.  
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.  
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.  
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.  
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.  
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.  
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

<h4 style="color:#00A688">Current Progress</h4>

The team has created many user stories, and team members have divided the user stories into individual tasks. Most of the team focuses on the application development while a small portion focuses on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed security review of the Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented a file to standardise the use of the addon prettier.
- Reviewed and made steps towards overhauling the Evoleon colour scheme.
- Added Help and Support screen to allow users to review common FAQs.
- Added a settings page to allow users to customise the Evoleon application better.
- Implemented a method for password verification through the confirm password box.
- Updated the error messages produced by Firebase to give users more constructive messages.
- Implemented the bottom navigation outlined in the high-fidelity design. Added comments for greater readability.

<h4 style="color:#00A688">Next Steps</h4>

The team is making steps towards implementing the code and design outlined in our high-fidelity designs. This will allow the app to be closer aligned to the EVAT project design and colour schemes outlined. The leadership team will review the documentation and update areas for a smooth and efficient handover.

I also added links for users to view the art. Using the Google API, I converted coordinates into addresses. The distance to each piece of art is also displayed. Furthermore, I integrated a map, expanded on the use case, and created another version to locate the nearest bar.|

So far, I have successfully extracted two datasets from the client website via API, processed the data into dataframe and merged them based on their longitude and latitude coordinates. I have grouped the landmarks and places of interest by their categories and the proximity from each other so that for every walk a tourist chooses to do, they can input their preference or areas of interest, and the tool would provide a list of relevant landmarks within a pre-determined walking distance parameter.  |

## <a name="cham"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Chameleon Website</h2>

#### Overview

The website for the Chameleon company overall aims to publicise the achievements and progress of Chameleon overall and showcase the sub-companies within it, one of the best ways to do this is through a website. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The website’s main objective is to provide a single source for all Chameleon-related matters, including other sub-companies information, objectives and links. We want to use the Chameleon website to advocate for the company and promote it while having the website be visually appealing and come with straightforward functionality.

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website and to make it optimised for mobile access. While the back-end has yet to be implemented, it means we have much scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal and implementing the Mailgun API and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing with the students’ design and web development skills. We want to deliver a high-quality, attractive, easy-to-navigate and high usability website. To do this, we will implement correct wireframing and prototyping techniques to develop a solid design that meets requirements before implementation.

It will be necessary for the Chameleon Website to showcase all the other projects being carried out by the Chameleon company. Therefore, incorporating these projects into the website has commenced, but links still need to be provided.

Overall, optimising the user website experience and reducing awkwardness is the primary aim for this trimester. 

#### Web Dev Team Progress 
This trimester, we have researched the ideal webmail API to use for the platform (Mailgun), began implenting the design teams design changes, decided upon what content should be placed in the resources section, and added new pages to accomodate the new content in the resources section. Updates and improvements have been made to the blog page, and a CSS framework (Bootstrap) has been decided upon to ensure consistincy across how stylings are written. SEO stratgies have also been researched. 


#### Web Design Team Progress
This trimester, we focused on redesigning the Chameleon website so all pages are consistent. Then the web development team can base their code on that design. Thus, the final product of our website will be high usability with consistency. We also create new logos for our Chameleon website and MOP, showing our company's values to the public.  

#### Our main achievements so far are listed below:
- Create the Chameleon website that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate, using the provided design from the design team as a guide
- Redesign the EV website: Signin, About Us and FAQ
- Redesign the Chameleon website: Homepage, About Us, Latest News, Profile, Login, Signup and Reset Password
- Research Email API's and decide to use Mailgun
- Research the Resource page in the Chameleon website. We plan to add information about IoT, Smart Home/Cities, Transportation and Energy management systems
- Research on SEO, CSS Framework and what information we will add in About Us page.
- Begin implementation of new high-fidelity designs.

#### Next Steps
The next steps for the remainder of this trimester is to update the frontend code of the website to match the designs as produced by the design team, as well as work on the backend to create a database for storing information and implementing the Mailgun API.

The design team will focus on working with the EV and MOP team leaders to complete design their websites and mobile applications. We will develop the remaining pages of the Chameleon website for the web development team to work on so they have high usability and consistency.   

#### Deliverables

- Implement a more aesthetic and navigation friendly website based on the design 
- Eliminate vulnerababilities after receiving a report from the Cybersecurity team
- New Chameleon Website and MOP logos
- Implement database 
- Implement Mailgun API
