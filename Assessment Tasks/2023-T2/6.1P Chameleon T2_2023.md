<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open Data Project engages with The City of Melbourne to support a greater use of their Open Data library for businesses, researchers, and software developers. The Melbourne Open Playground (MOP) is an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage open data using real-world scenarios in order to assist The City of Melbourne to achieve key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company and present it in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and displays the progress of each of its three projects and outlines their goals. This project aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

### <a name="objectives"></a>Trimester 2 2023 Objectives
As well as moving each of the Chameleon projects closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.


- Create and document a policy for the creation and storage of documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. The process will include, migrating company documents to GitHub and converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future studentsb fvc. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company including:
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Having multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester
The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited. Furthermore, the team aims to implement policies for shared coding practices to provide future teams with detailed references.

#### Deliverables
- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

#### Current Progress
The team has created a significant number of user stories, and team members have divided up the user stories into individual tasks. Majority of the team is focusing on the application development while a small portion of the team is focusing on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed security review of Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented "About" Screen providing an overview of the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the application's version.
- Implemented "Terms and Conditions" Screen.
- Created password reset functionalities allowing users to reset their passwords if required.
- Implemented "User Details Update" Screen that allows users to change their personal details.
- Created a central Documents directory within the GitHub Repository and began adding policy documents in markdown.
- Updated GitHub repo readme to include a linking directory to the new policy documents. 

#### Next Steps
The team will continue to implement code for additional user interface pages along with adding user authentication functionalities. Furthermore, the team will focus on consolidating current achievements to form a plan for the handover process to ensure future teams have all the necessary information to continue working on the project.

## <a name="cham"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Chameleon Website</h2>

#### Overview

The website for the Chameleon company overall aims to publicise the achievements and progress of Chameleon overall and showcase the sub-companies within it, one of the best ways to do this is through a website. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The main objectives of this website is to provide a one-stop for all – where it includes all the other sub-companies’ infortmation, objectives and links. We want to be able to use this website to advocate for the company, and be able to promote it while having the website be visually appealing, and comes with easy functionality.

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website majority, and make it optimised for mobile access. While the backend hasn’t been implemented, it means we have a lot of scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal, implementing API’s with Mailgun, Bootstrap and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing, with the design and web development skills of the students. We want to deliver a high-quality attrractive, easy to navigate and overall simple aesthetic of the website. This also means through using correct wireframing techniques within the design team, agreeing on a solid design that meets this criteria before implementing.

It will be imporant for the Chameleon Website to present all the other projects for the Chameleon company on the website, while this has currently been started – links have not been provided. 

Overall, reducing awkwardness on the website and providing a smooth experience is the overall aim for this trimester. 

#### Web Dev Team Progress 
This trimester, we have researched databases so that they can be implemented within our user login pages, and along with this how API's can be used to implement this within our website. We focused on making our website more intuative and interactive for users, and created a SRS use cases document to continue using throughout the trimester. Additionally we also analysed for SEO startegy works so our website can be presented higher on a search engine. As the research has now been completed, we plan to start changing the website and coding in the backend API's. We are making ongoing efforts to implement the design teams new high-fidelity visuals across the site. Improvements have been made page by page. 

#### Web Dev Team Design 
The design team have developed low-fidelity designs, as well as produce high-fidelity designs for all pages of the Chameleon website. Researching and testing various colour schemes to create more modernised look with light and dark variations of the website. Research into the redevelopment of the Chameleon 'Resources' page has also identified the potential implementation of an event calendar to showcase company related events, FAQ and emerging IoT technologies. Development of low-fidelity page designs the EV Adoption Tools website has begun and the Evoleon mobile application is undergoing a redesign with the collaboration of the EV Adoption Tools web development team.

The main list of achievements so far can include:
- Completed research on database in the case of user login
- Use cases document has been created to help students analyse functionalities of the website
- Webmail API research on Sendgrid, Mailgun and MailChimp. Mailgun was decided upon as the best solution  
- Designs being completed for majority of the website; lo-fi and hi-fi
- User personas have been created for all 3 websites
- Steady implementation of new designs in code

#### Next Steps
The next steps for the remainder of this trimester is to update the frontend code of the website to match the designs as produced by he design team, as well as work on the backend user signing in database and login setup and having this be functional and implementing the Mailgun API. We also plan to implement a pop up notifcation subscriber method for users. Through the changes by the design team we have analysed the interaction of the website and how realisitic it will be for users. The design team will focus on working with the EV and MOP teams and their respective web development team leaders to begin design work for their websites and mobile applications. 

#### Deliverables
Deliverables largely remain the same from the start of the trimester, with progress remaining on track for most sections.  

- Implement a more aesthetic and navigation friendly design (designs complete, code implementation ongoing)
- Work on the blogging section of the website – add links to other projects (ongoing, improvements made)
