# **Executive Summary** <a name="ExecutiveSummary"></a>

## Our Mission

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

At Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

## Our Structure

There are currently three active divisions within the company (EV will not be running in T3), focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

-   Chameleon Security (CS)
-   City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
-   Chameleon Website (CW)

MOP leverage’s datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

### Chameleon Security

The _Chameleon Security Project_ engages with the _City of Melbourne Open Data Project_ (_Melbourne Open Playground_ – _MOP_), and the _Chameleon Website Project_, to perform security testing, development of security guidelines, and recommendations, to guide the other projects in the security of their systems and applications. The _Chameleon Security Project_ was formerly engaged under the _MOP Project, however, has been separated to_ operate as its own entity, to enable security testing of all projects that fall under the _Chameleon_ company.

### City of Melbourne Open Data

The City of Melbourne Open Data Project engages with The City of Melbourne to support a greater use of their Open Data library for businesses, researchers, and software developers. The Melbourne Open Playground (MOP) is an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage open data using real-world scenarios to assist The City of Melbourne to achieve key strategic goals.

### Chameleon Website

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company and present it in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and displays the progress of each of its three projects and outlines their goals. This project aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

## Chameleon Security

### Overview

The Chameleon Security team intends to operate independently within the company with a dedicated focus on strengthening the digital security of its projects. This trimester the security team aims to align its work with the Melbourne Open Data Project (MOP) and Chameleon Website Project. The overarching goal is to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities, as shown through different initiatives. E.g. SSL testing, compliance audits aligned with national and international security standards, and the execution of a variety of security attacks, (including DDoS and SQL injection, on both the Chameleon and MOP websites).

As a team, we will be working closely with the Chameleon Website Development team to ensure high-quality security and through this collaboration improve the overall project where possible. The security team will aim to not only work on the security of the projects and web pages of the company but also encourage the development of wider project through documenting findings and problem solving to aid in the growth of the wider project landscape. This will also aid in the project handover at the end of the six weeks.

### Goals and Objectives

The project includes the development of a training program which includes the usage of the security applications, identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring the platform's robustness A platform that concretely demonstrates the practical application of open data. It is designed to meet the needs of a variety of stakeholders, including industry professionals, government agencies and academic researchers. The aim of this project is to find the different vulnerabilities in the chameleon website by usage of the different attacks such as SSL, XMAS etc, while the long-term aim is to encourage the use of data and provide innovative and informed solutions to contemporary issues within Melbourne City Council.

### Aims This Trimester

The following aim for this trimester is that the Chameleon security project team can work with team members to transition smoothly over as Chameleon security project team is now a separate entity operated on its own. Following this the aim for this trimester would be to perform security testing, development of security guidelines & lastly to recommend other projects what security features & vulnerabilities they should be aware of.

## Chameleon Website

### Overview

The Chameleon website project is a source of information for potential clients and the public to learn about Chameleon and its operations. The Chameleon website will display information relating to Chameleon, its various projects and some resources explaining what IoT technologies are.

### Goals and Objectives

The Chameleon website aims to provide an accessible only source of information to explain and advocate for Chameleon and its projects, helping to generate interest in the company and its offerings. The Chameleon website aims to be a pleasant experience across a wide variety of screen sizes and devices.

### Aims This Trimester

The aims for this trimester are to implement an enhanced pop-up notifications system for user accounts on the Chameleon website, to give users a way of quickly receiving new information related to their activities on the Chameleon website, create a responsive design that is scalable across a wide range of devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and pleasant design experience no matter where a user accesses the website.

We also aim to enhance the user experience in other ways, such as adding light and dark mode themes, implementing a support chatbot, and implementing a newsletter system. The design team will contain to refine various visual components, focusing on responsive mobile designs, further use cases and assisting with MOP design. Some web pages will require updates to the underlying technologies to ensure compatibility with the main project (the reset password page is currently not using React JSX).

Lastly, we will enhance the backend by increasing security (adding HTTPS and SSL), migrating from AWS to GCP, and adding a backend database (Firebase currently decided on) to store user account credentials, files and apply SSO options to the website. Incorporating the other projects websites into the main Chameleon website is also being considered to increase the strength of the branding and minimise confusion amongst newcomers, although much of this is undecided on at the time of writing.

### Deliverables

The following key deliverables have been identified to be required this trimester:
- Complete low fidelity/wireframe mobile site designs
- Complete high-fidelity Figma mobile prototypes
- Complete use case document suite
- Finalise design requirements and specifications for design team roll off at end of T3.
- Complete general design refinements
- Implement responsive / mobile designs.
- Implement pop up notification system.
- Port required pages to React JSX
- Implement dark / light mode themes.
- Migrate website from AWS to GCP.
- Implement backend database (Firebase) for user accounts.
- Implement chatbot, picking up from code written in T2.
- Implement newsletter service, picking up from code written in T2.
- Merge News and Blog page.
- Implement HTTPS and SSL security enhancements.
- Port other project websites to main websites codebase (pending deliverable)

### Completion Summary

The website project has seen substantial progress in both areas, design, and development. Key design milestones including low and high-fidelity mobile designs have been accomplished, alongside the creation of a dark-mode palette for the user experience. Backend work has been robust, with ongoing development of the newsletter services from the previous trimester, and authentication service via Firebase. Notable technical enhancements encompass porting from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsiveness and porting all pages to JSX. Furthermore, strategic planning for cloud deployment and CI/CD Pipeline implementation is in progress, promising efficient deployment. While some tasks like porting other project websites and migration to GCP is pending, the achieved milestones reflect project’s advancement, positioning project for successful completion within the timeline.
