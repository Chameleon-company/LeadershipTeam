## Data Science Leadership Guide
Written T2 2023 - 29/09/2023

In some cases, there are not enough leaders to carry onto the next trimester or the majority of members in the team are seniors and are leaving the capstone project. 
In situations like this, it is vital that knowledge and experiences of the leadership team be left behind so that future leadership students know what to. Capstone projects can be very complex to understand because there are constantly different
people working on different projects across the years and it can be difficult to ascertain where to pick up where others have left off. This guide is written to help the Data science leadership team carry out their leadership duties during the trimester. 

### The beginning of the trimester
At the start of the trimester, it is important to build a team of leaders. Ask students if they want to become a leader. The MOP team (which is comprised of 3 groups; Data Science, Web Dev and Cybersecurity) will usually have at least 2
project leaders which look after the entire MOP project. Make sure to consult with the MOP Project leaders during the trimester. The MOP project leaders will also be setting up everything and will be asking students if they want to be leaders.
If there are any juniors from last trimester coming back as seniors, they make ideal leadership candidates because they should be already familiar with the project. 

In the Datascience project, the Chameleon > City of Melbourne section is for general announcements. Each MOP project operates from it's own group chat. Our one is called Chameleon Data Science & Engineering Team 2 2023 and this will be where you operate from as well.

### The worklog

In the first few weeks you should be focusing on collating all the work that needs to be done during the trimester. 

To get a good idea of what was done last trimester, go to Chameleon in Teams > City of Melbourne > Files > Resources > Data Science & Engineering > Team Projects (T2-2023) 

You will find an excel file with the worklog for the previous trimester. This file is split into two sections; API repointing and new use case ideas. 
You should start working on creating a new worklog. Duplicate the old worklog, delete the names and edit the file to include the work load for your trimester.

- #### What is API Repointing?
Many use cases have been published on the [MOP website](https://mop-code-webapp-e5xbpzcnea-ts.a.run.app/). Some of these use cases are a few years old and use an old API. That means that if you were to run these use cases, they wouldn't work. 
[Melbourne Open Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/?sort=modified) has a new updated API. In the excel document you will see 4 yellow boxes. These are the APIs that are yet to be repointed. All other APIs have been repointed and reworked. 
You can assign students to work on these last 4 projects. 

The following [tutorial](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/sites/Chameleon2/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FChameleon2%2FShared%20Documents%2FCity%20Of%20Melbourne%2FResources%2FTutorial%2FAPIs%20%26%20python%20%28Jupyter%29%2D20230402%5F151201%2DMeeting%20Recording%2Emp4&referrer=Teams%2ETEAMS%2DELECTRON&referrerScenario=p2p%5Fns%2Dbim) 
is a good introduction into not only API repointing but use cases in general. 
The video should be shown to new students at the start of the trimester.

- #### New use case ideas

The second part of the excel file shows people's new use case ideas. This is the section where students have brainstormed new use case ideas and have started working on them. Some of these ideas have been completed and others have not. 
You can check the [MOP github repo here](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP-Code/tree/master/datascience) to see what work has been completed and what hasn't. Please read the readme.md if you are unfamiliar with the repo.

### Brainstorming new use case ideas

Around week 2-3, the first task you can assign to students is to brainstorm new use case ideas. In our trimester, we brainstormed some new ideas for the future students. You can use these ideas. 

You can find the file in Chameleon in Teams > City of Melbourne > Files > Ideation > MOP_Second_Ideation_T2_2023

Ideally you want enough of a backlog so that everyone can work on a use case. It should also be noted that up to 2 students can work on one use case. So students can either choose to work solo or with a partner.

Remember a use case combines 2 or more datasets to create an informative and interactive analysis and visualization. The subject of the use case must fit under either Transport & Safety, Environment & Wellbeing and Business & Activity. 
Datasets can be obtained from the Open Data Melbourne website but are not limited to just this site, you can get them from anywhere.

### Releasing the work log 

Once you have created a new updated worklog, make an announcement to the group and post it in the chat. Aim to do this around week 3 at the latest. Students can then pick a project and begin working on it.

### Team Meetings

As mentioned before, team meetings will be hosted on a weekly basis. How you choose to conduct them is up to you. But generally a good idea is to let each student talk about what they're working on and if they need help with anything. 
The first few meetings will probably be just explaining the project to juniors and new students. The minutes for each meeting should be updated each meeting and each meeting should be recorded. Generally a meeting goes for around 1 hour.

Go to Chameleon in Teams > City of Melbourne > Files > Team Meetings > DS & Eng

Here you will find various meeting minutes and recordings. Just duplicate these minutes in your own folder (eg. T3 2023). Use the meeting minutes to record student attendance and topics of discussion.

Generally we encourage different students to host the meetings each week, especially if they are leadership students. Hosting the meeting just means you write the minutes and lead the discussion in the meeting such as asking students to present their work. 
This isn't neccessary but it's better because students can use it as evidence of their contributions. 

### Trello 

The trello board lists all the sprints and work of the MOP project. It can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/ln6GEN45/melbourne-city). You can use it to keep track of work and what each student is doing.

### Company tasks

The leadership team will have to complete company tasks which is 2.1p, 6.1p and 11.2p. This is mostly updating the sections for each Chameleon project. Your MOP project leaders will usually tell you what to do, please consult with them.

### Github

Students must commit and merge to the company repo to provide evidence of their work through the trimester. Refer students to this [github guide](https://github.com/Chameleon-company/MOP-Code/tree/master/datascience). 

### Brainstorming new use case ideas - Second round

Towards the end of the trimester, around week 8 or 9, you may want to brainstorm new use case ideas for the next lot of students. Though this depends on how many new use case ideas you have that haven't been started. 
If you have enough of a backlog, say around 5+ new use case ideas that haven't been started then this may be enough to get the next lot of students started. This is up to you. 

### Client Meetings

The MOP project has a client at the City of Melbourne. At the start and end of the trimester, you will present to the client. You may not necessarily have to present yourself but you may be asked 
to work on some slides for example. Please consult the MOP Project leaders for more details. 

### Leadership Meetings

There are leadership meetings that are hosted for the Chameleon leadership. Please consult your MOP project leaders for more details. 

### End of the trimester

Towards the end of the trimester you will need to start wrapping everything up. Consult with students to find out what work has been completed. You will need to tell students to put their work in the appropriate github folders. 

### Closing notes
Remember if you have any questions, please consult the MOP project leaders for further information. If students are not participating or engaging throughout the trimester, try to make contact with them to find out why. 
You should make an effort to help them engage but ultimately it is not your responsibility to make sure they do any work, it is their responsibility to engage and get work done.

Please note that this is not meant to be a comprehensive guide but rather a general overview of what must be done as a leader. This guide may change over time as the data science team takes on new responbilities and may become outdated so feel free to update this guide for future leaders. Good luck!
